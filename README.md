### Implementing EmailJS 📨
In order to improve our service, we work with EmailJS. Which is a service that allows you to send emails directly from client-side JavaScript code without the need for a server-side component. It provides an easy-to-use API that enables you to integrate email functionality into your web applications seamlessly. Over here, consists in the user sending us feedback, which is linked to the gmail created for receiving the messages in 'Help Us Improve'. This is possible thanks to html and js connections.

### YMAL 💪🧑‍💻
A human-readable data serialization format. In the provided codes, YAML is used to define GitHub Actions workflows. The first workflow, "DevSkim", runs security scans triggered by pushes, pull requests, and a scheduled basis (every Saturday). It checks for vulnerabilities and uploads results to GitHub's Security tab. The second workflow, "Lint Javascript", lints JavaScript code on pushes and pull requests. It checks code using ESLint and ensures code quality. YAML's structured format enables clear and readable automation of development tasks in these workflows.
